# Sentiment Analysis with Machine learning and Deep Learning models

## Models:
In this project, i have implemented the following models used for sentiment analysis purposes:
1. BERT (base case)
2. CNN
3. Inception 
4. LSTM
5. Support Vector Machines
6. Linear regression
7. Naive Bayesian

## Dataset:
The dataset that i used come from the Kaggel about products review on e-commerce platforms, basically it contains:
- 30,460 observations
- 6,669 negative labels
- 4,698 neutral labels
